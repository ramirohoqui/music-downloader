# music-downloader

Hello, welcome to my first python project. A music downloader.
I practice water sports and have this mp3 oldschool device where i should manually download songs to it.
I have been taking some python courses and realized that figuring out a way to automate my music download process would
be a great place to start! 
Hope this little project helps someone else save hours of manually downloading each song from youtube as it did to me. 
beforehand apologies if the code is sloppy, im working to improve my presentations!

cheers
